Homotopy Type Theory in Agda
============================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HoTT/HoTT-Agda.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/HoTT/HoTT-Agda)

This repository contains a development of homotopy type theory and univalent
foundations in Agda.  The structure of the source code is described below.

Setup
-----

The code is loosely broken into `core` and `theorems` Agda libraries.
You need Agda 2.5.3 or newer
and include at least the path to `core.agda-lib` in your Agda library list.
See `CHANGELOG` of Agda 2.5 for more information.

Agda Options
------------

Each Agda file should have `--without-K --rewriting` in its header.
`--without-K` is to restrict pattern matching so that the uniqueness of identity proofs is not admissible,
and `--rewriting` is for the computational rules of the higher inductive types.

Style and naming conventions
----------------------------

### General

- Line length should be reasonably short, not much more than 80 characters
  (TODO: except maybe sometimes for equational reasoning?)
- Directories are in lowercase and modules are in CamelCase
- Types are Capitalized unless they represent properties (like `is-prop`)
- Terms are in lowercase-with-hyphens-between-words
  unless the words refer to types.
- Try to avoid names of free variables in identifiers
- Pointedness and other disambiguating labels may be omitted if inferable from prefixes.

TODO: principles of variable names

### Identity type

The identity type is `_==_`, because `_=_` is not allowed in Agda. For every
identifier talking about the identity type, the single symbol `=` is used
instead, because this is allowed by Agda. For instance the introduction rule for
the identity type of Σ-types is `pair=` and not `pair==`.

### Truncation levels

The numbering is the homotopy-theoretic numbering, parametrized by the type
`TLevel` or `ℕ₋₂` where

    data TLevel : Type₀ where
      ⟨-2⟩ : TLevel
      S : TLevel → TLevel

    ℕ₋₂ = TLevel

Numeric literals (including negative ones) are overloaded.
There is also explicit conversion `⟨_⟩ : ℕ → ℕ₋₂` with the obvious definition.

### Properties of types

Names of the form `is-X` or `has-X`, represent properties that can hold (or not)
for some type `A`. Such a property can be parametrized by some arguments. The
property is said to hold for a type `A` iff `is-X args A` is inhabited. The
types `is-X args A` should be (h-)propositions.

Examples:

    is-contr
    is-prop
    is-set
    has-level       -- This one has one argument of type [ℕ₋₂]
    has-all-paths   -- Every two points are equal
    has-dec-eq      -- Decidable equality

- The theorem stating that some type `A` (perhaps with arguments) has some
  property `is-X` is named `A-is-X`. The arguments of `A-is-X` are the arguments
  of `is-X` followed by the arguments of `A`.
- Theorems stating that any type satisfying `is-X` also satisfies `is-Y` are
  named `X-is-Y` (and not `is-X-is-Y` which would mean `is-Y (is-X A)`).

Examples (only the nonimplicit arguments are given)

    Unit-is-contr : is-contr Unit
    Bool-is-set : is-set Bool
    is-contr-is-prop : is-contr (is-prop A)
    contr-is-prop : is-contr A → is-prop A
    dec-eq-is-set : has-dec-eq A → is-set A
    contr-has-all-paths : is-contr A → has-all-paths A

The term giving the most natural truncation level to some type constructor T is
called `T-level`:

    Σ-level : (n : ℕ₋₂) → (has-level n A) → ((x : A) → has-level n (P x))
           → has-level n (Σ A P)
    ×-level : (n : ℕ₋₂) → (has-level n A) → (has-level n B)
           → has-level n (A × B))
    Π-level : (n : ℕ₋₂) → ((x : A) → has-level n (P x))
           → has-level n (Π A P)
    →-level : (n : ℕ₋₂) → (has-level n B)
           → has-level n (A → B))

Similar suffices include `conn` for connectivity.

### Lemmas of types

Modules of the same name as a type collects useful properties
given an element of that type. Records have this functionality built-in.

### Functions and equivalences

- A natural function between two types `A` and `B` is often called `A-to-B`
- If `f : A → B`, the lemma asserting that `f` is an equivalence is called
  `f-is-equiv`.
- If `f : A → B`, the equivalence `(f , f-is-equiv)` is called `f-equiv`.
- As a special case of the previous point, `A-to-B-equiv` is usually called
  `A-equiv-B` instead.

We have

    A-to-B : A → B
    A-to-B-is-equiv : is-equiv (A-to-B)
    A-to-B-equiv : A ≃ B
    A-equiv-B : A ≃ B
    A-to-B-path : A == B
    A-is-B : A == B

Also for group morphisms, we have

    G-to-H : G →ᴳ H
    G-to-H-is-iso : is-equiv (fst G-to-H)
    G-to-H-iso : G ≃ᴳ H
    G-iso-H : G ≃ᴳ H

However, `A-is-B` can be easily confused with `is-X` above,
so it should be used with great caution.

Another way of naming of equivalences only specifies one side.
Suffixes `-econv` may be added for clarity.
The suffix `-conv` refers to the derived path.

    A : A == B
    A-econv : A ≃ B
    A-conv : A == B

TODO: `pres` and `preserves`.

TODO: `-inj` and `-surj` for injectivity and surjectivity.

TODO: `-nat` for naturality.

### Negative types

The constructor of a record should usually be the uncapitalized name of the
record. If `N` is a negative type (for instance a record) with introduction
rule `n` and elimination rules `e1`, …, `en`, then

- The identity type on `N` is called `N=`
- The intros and elim rules for the identity type on `N` are called `n=` and
  `e1=`, …, `en=`
- If necessary, the double identity type is called `N==` and similarly for the
  intros and elim.
- The β-elimination rules for the identity type on `N` are called `e1=-β`, …,
  `en=-β`.
- The η-expansion rule is called `n=-η` (TODO: maybe `N=-η` instead, or
  additionally?)
- The equivalence/path between `N=` and `_==_ {N}` is called
- `N=-equiv`/`N=-path` (TODO: `n=-equiv`/`n=-path` would maybe be more natural).
   Note that this equivalence is usually needed in the direction `N= ≃ _==_ {N}`

If a positive type `N` behaves like a negative one through
some access function `f : N → M`,
the property is called `f-ext : (n₁ n₂ : N) → f n₁ = f n₂ → n₁ = n₂`

### Functoriality

A family of some structures indexed by another structures
often behaves like a functor which maps functions between structures
to functions between corresponding structures.
Here is a list of standardized suffices that denote different kind of functoriality:

- `X-fmap`: `X` maps morphisms to morphisms (covariantly or contravariantly).
- `X-csmap`: `X` maps commuting squares to commuting squares (covariantly or contravariantly).
- `X-emap`: `X` maps isomorphisms to isomorphisms.
- `X-isemap`: Usually a part of `X-emap` which lifts the proof of being an isomorphism.

For types, morphisms are functions and isomorphisms are equivalences.
Bi-functors are not standardized (yet).

TODO: `X-fmap-id`, `X-fmap-∘`

### Precedence

Precedence convention

1. Separators ```_$_``` and arrows: 0
2. Layout combinators (equational reasoning): 10-15
3. Equalities, equivalences: 30
4. Other relations, operators with line-level separators: 40
5. Constructors (for example ```_,_```): 60
6. Binary operators (including type formers like ```_×_```): 80
7. Prefix operators: 100
8. Postfix operators: 120

### Inductive types and higher ones

- See ```core/lib/types/Pushout.agda``` for an example of higher inductive types.

- Constructors should make all the parameters implicit, and varients which make
  commonly specified parameters explicit should have the suffix ```'```.

- ```S0``` is defined as ```Bool```, and the circle is the suspension of ```Bool```.

### Algebraic rules

### Groups

Structure of the source
-----------------------

The structure of the source is roughly the following:

### Old code (directory `old/`)

The old library is still present, mainly to facilitate code transfer to the new
library. Once everything has been ported to the new library, this directory will
be removed.

### Core library (directory `core/`)

The main library is more or less divided in three parts.

- The first part is exported in the module `lib.Basics` and contains everything
  needed to make the second part compile
- The second part is exported in the module `lib.types.Types` and contains
  everything you ever wanted to know about all type formers
- The third part contains more advanced stuff.

The whole library is exported in the file `HoTT`, so every file using the
library should contain `open import HoTT`.

TODO: describe more precisely each file

- `MayerVietoris`: Given a pointed span X ←f– Z –g→ Y, shows the cofiber space of the natural map `reglue` : X ∨ Y → X ⊔\_Z Y is equivalent to the suspension of Z. Using this equivalence one can derive the Mayer–Vietoris sequence from the long exact sequence associated with `reglue`.
- `PtdMapSequence`: Functions for applying a cohomology theory to a sequence of pointed maps, producing a sequence of group homomorphisms.
- `RephraseSubFinCoboundary`: Gives a description the homomorphism induced in cohomology by a map from a bouquet of (n+1)-spheres to the suspension of a bouquet of n-spheres in terms of mapping degrees. This is used for defining cellular cohomology.

- `SubFinBouquet`: Constructs an explicit inverse to the function from the cohomology of the wedge of m-spheres indexed over a subfinite type `B` to the product (indexed over `B`) of the 0-th cohomology groups of the 0-sphere.

- `Theory`: Defines a data type `CohomologyTheory` of cohomology theories fulfilling some axioms similar to the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms and proves some basic consequences of these axioms.
- `Torus`: Contains a computation of the cohomology of the n-torus.
- `Wedge`: Gives an isomorphism between Cⁿ(X ∨ Y) and Cⁿ(X) × Cⁿ(Y) (“finite additivity”) without using the additivity axiom and shows that e.g. the projection map to Cⁿ(X) is induced by the inclusion of X in X ∨ Y and similarly for other maps.
